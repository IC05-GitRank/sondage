			Gitrank is a Search Toolbar that allows you to rank JS projects following <span style="color:orange;">maintainability standards</span>.
			<br /><br />
			The developers will be able to know the maintainability rate of their projects and <span style="color:orange;">predict when their code could break</span> without being judged on the content of their work. It will allow all programmers to explore different topics according to criterions that they will choose but, to do this, we have to determine this criterions and calibrate them. Could you please be serious when you fill this survey so that we can make a good calibration ?
			<br /><br />
			This project is open source and developed by five engineering and design students from the University of Technology of Compiegne.
