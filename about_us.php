			GitRank is a research project that aims at providing maintainability indicators of open source projects hosted on Github.
			<br /><br />
			Developers will eventually discover a maintainability score of open source projects, based on various criteria that we will select during the course of this research project. Determining if a third-party project is maintained enough to be used into another projects is a key issue is software development. However assessing whether projects are "maintained enough" to be reliable is a difficult question.
			<br /><br />
			Our approach is to explore statistical criteria that provide insightful and objective information on the maintainability state of open source projects, without analyzing their source code. Activities observed on repositories such as commits, issues, and pull requests may indeed provide relevant data to analyze.
			<br /><br />
			We first launch a survey to help us score "at first sight" the maintainability of 50 Javascript projects. Would you rely on them for your own projects?
			<br /><br />
			We are five engineering and design students from the Université de Technologie de Compiègne. Help us build new quality tools for the open source community!"
